> Robust Anomaly Detection for Multivariate Time Series through Temporal GCNs and Attention-based VAE

## Dependencies
Recent versions of the following packages for Python 3 are required:
* numpy==1.21.2
* torch==1.9.1
* scipy==1.7.1
* scikit-learn==0.24.2
* pandas==0.25.0

## Datasets
### Link
The used datasets are available at:
* MSL&SMAP https://github.com/khundman/telemanom
* 

### Preprocess
We compress the data set into a mat format file, which includes the following contents.
* edges: array of subnetworks after coupling, each element in the array is a subnetwork.
* features: attributes of each node in the network.
* labels: label of labeled points.
* train: index of training set points for node classification. 
* valid: index of validation set points for node classification.
* test: index of test set points for node classification.

In addition, we also sample the positive and negative edges in the network, and divide them into three text files: train, valid and test for link prediction.

## Usage
First, you need to determine the data set. If you want to do node classification tasks, you need to modify the data set path in `Node_classification.py`. If you want to do link prediction, you need to modify the dataset path in `Link_prediction.py`.
